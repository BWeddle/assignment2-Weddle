## The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art
One of the exhibits you must see while there is the **Photography exhibit**, specifically the print they have of Dorothea Lange's *Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California*, a rather haunting photo of a mother and her two children from 1936 in a camp for field workers. Another exhibit you have to see is the **Donald J. Hall Sculpture Park**, which is out on the front lawn of the museum, which includes the giant shuttlecocks that are synonymous with the museum.
